    summary: |
      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

2023년도에 전북대학교 행정학과에 입학한 후 전과하여 현재 컴퓨터인공지능학부에 재학 중인 학부생입니다. 아직 정해진 명확한 진로는 없지만 인공지능에 대해서 좀 더 깊이있게 공부해보고 싶습니다.
