#     summary: |
#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

I am an undergraduate student who entered the Department of Public Administration at Jeonbuk National University in 2023 and later transferred to the Department of Computer Artificial Intelligence. I do not have a clear career path yet, but I would like to study artificial intelligence more deeply.
