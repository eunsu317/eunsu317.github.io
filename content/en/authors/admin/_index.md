     제 유일한 경력입니다.^^ 1학년 1학기 때 "인공지능의 이해"라는 교양 과목을 듣고 인공지능에 대해 더 알아보고 싶다는 생각이 들어서 2학기부터 본격적으로 컴퓨터인공지능학부 전공을 수강하기 시작했습니다. 겨울방학에 면접을 보고 최종 합격했습니다.

#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

I am an undergraduate student who entered the Department of Public Administration at Jeonbuk National University in 2023 and later transferred to the Department of Computer Artificial Intelligence. I do not have a clear career path yet, but I would like to study artificial intelligence more deeply.
